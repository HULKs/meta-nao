# meta-nao - Yocto layer for Softbank Nao V6

This layer provides support for Softbank Nao V6 robot to construct a custom image as an alternative to the original image in context of RoboCup SPL.

In general this image should be usable at this point, and if it isn't this is considered a bug and we appreciate a report by opening an issue.
As this is a first attempt with the Yocto project and image construction for the Nao robot, Team HULKs is interested in suggestions regarding code quality and style as well as best-practices.
